# Pychain

This Streamlit-interface app is a simple Python-coded proof-of-work blockchain that records basic
transaction data (sender, receiver, amount, timestamp).
The interface has a sidebar that allows toggling of the nonce size / mining difficulty,
and a blockchain validator. 

## User instructions

If not already installed, install Streamlit by typing into your Terminal CLI:
```
pip install streamlit
```

Clone the repository, navigate to the directory in Terminal, and run the program:
```
streamlit run pychain.py
```
